        <h1>Ourhistory:-</h1>
        <br>
        <p>"History (from Ancient Greek: ἱστορία, romanized: historíā, lit. 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation') is the study and the documentation of the past." This preusumed definition of history is not everything that it seems to be. This sentence should actually say instead that history is the comprehensive study of the past using both including archeological and historiographic methods. These definitions are not the same way they appear to be, the first one just reduces the ehole subject to a pitifully constrained definition.</p>
